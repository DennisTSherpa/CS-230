The following are questions that I will answer to provide a brief overview of my Software Design Document.

1.	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    - Answer:    
        - The client: The Gaming Room
        - Software Design Requested: The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It            or Lose It, which is currently available as an Android app only.
2.	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    - Answer:
        - By outlining the prerequisites for Draw or Lose It in accordance with  the client’s request, I was able to provide a clear overview of what is required for their software’s success.
        - Also, I recommended a reasonable path to the client on how to proceed with implementation.
3.	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    - Answer:
        - Because the design document provides a step-by-step guide from start to finish, the development of code becomes more implementation than                    creation, which is less strenuous and time-consuming work.
4.	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    - Answer:
        - I would revise my Recommendations section.
        - That section covers an abundance of topics and is based on my level of experience. 
        - Therefore, by increasing my knowledge on those areas I could provide The Gaming Room with a more refined set of recommendations.
5.	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    - Answer:
        - I read and segregated the user’s needs into a to-do list, then I completed each task in the written order.
        - The software is designed for the user, so it must fulfill the user’s needs. 
        - Therefore, considering the user’s needs when designing is a must because that will form the foundation of the software design.
6.	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
    - Answer: 
        - I approached it with a clear and focused mindset.
        - I would follow the following steps:
            - Understand the user’s needs.
            - Create a to-do list (in order, meaning first to last step) for the software design according to the user’s needs.
            - Complete the to-do list in the written order.
            - Check and refine.
